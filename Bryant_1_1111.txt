What will you accomplish today? (Towards your sound story? towards submitting missing assignments?)
I'm just hoping github will work and let me push out all my missing assignments. I have to do my music video at home because this computer doesn't like openshot, but at least I have an idea for my soundstory, which is cool.
I'm really salty and bitter about not being able to get stuff done in this class, oops.
