What is a sound story? How might one create a sound story? Where does one get appropriately licensed sound effects for a sound story?
A sound story is a story composed of several different prerecorded sounds to tell us something. 
You basically grab a whole bunch of different sounds and put them togther.
You find a website. You pray everything is properly licensed.

What looks useful? Why?
Wow look at all these most likely properly licensed and hopefully free prerecorded sounds and sound editors
