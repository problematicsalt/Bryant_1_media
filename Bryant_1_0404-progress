1) What deliverable do you have?
I have refined my randomized sounds to be what many consider very annoying. It's so annoying that I've given myself a headache. Amazing. 
2) What have you accomplished this week?
I have accomplished finalizing my sounds (for now).
3) What's left to do?
*Incorporate the accelerometer + switch
*Box?
*Make the sound louder?
*Murder
4) What will you have to turn in on Friday?
Hopefully a somewhat functioning annoying machine. I can't guarentee the whole thing, but the basic things I wanted originally:
*An annoying sound that's activated with a switch
*You can flick it on and off but the accelerometer is the key to turn it off (no spoilers)
*Maybe wrapped up in a little box, too
