What animation problems have you solved this week? Please describe.

I've solved too many problems to count. No, just kidding. I've solved a few problems this week. 

* Figuring out how to save files without screwing up said files
* Re-Figuring out how to rig, because I forgot and lost what I had done previously.
* Fixing modeling problems.

Problems I have yet to fix: 

* Completely fixing the models so they're how I want
* Finishing rigging
* Figuring out how to start animating
* Not being a whiner about 3D animation, apparently (according to my dad).
* Making my scene more unique
