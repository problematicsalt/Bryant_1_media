What challenges are you facing? 
Specifically - have you rendered and submitted anything? Why or why not?

The challenge I am facing currently for this animation is finding the will to continue with it. I struggle to understand how to use Blender and find myself stuck with three times the problems I had originally whenever I find one solution.

I have not rendered or submitted anything because I do not have anything to render or submit. I'm disgruntled with what I have right now, and it's pretty pathetic as I've started over twice do to errors I couldn't fix, and the people helping me could not help me fix.
I'm sure that after I get past this rough patch I'll have something to render and submit, though.
