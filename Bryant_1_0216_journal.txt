If I were to show my installation piece today, I wouldn't have anything to show. I don't have anything but the code I need, my Arduino, and a box that's not even complete. I still need my actuated switch at the least to finish up my box, but other than that I really don't have anything to show.
Whether or not I finish this week all depends on when my parts come in. I don't have enough right now to get anything else done.
I really need my parts before I can do anything else.
