  GNU nano 2.4.2                                        File: Bryant_0503-animation-frame-by-frame                                                                                      

The 12 principles of animation:

        * Squash and Stretch
        * Anticipation
        * Staging
        * Straight Ahead Action and Pose to Pose
        * Follow Through and Overlapping Action
        * Slow In and Slow Out
        * Arc
        * Secondary Action
        * Timing
        * Exaggeration
        * Solid Drawing
        * Appeal
What makes these 12 principles so important?
        They make an animation more realistic, and help the audience actually tell what's going on.
What are four of the principles you will incorporate?
        Probably these:
                *Squash and Stretch
                *Staging
                *Arc
                *Timing
        I will incorporate these someway somehow, although I'm not sure of the specifics right now.
