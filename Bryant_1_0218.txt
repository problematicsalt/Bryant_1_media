My promotional poster for my project would probably be somewhat comical, almost a joke, but not quite. Kind of like my project as a whole, too. Cool, interesting, comical, and somewhat of a joke that's overdone and really annoying. I'm not sure about the style or the colors yet, but I know it's going to be very comical overall. 
I know I want to make it all short and sweet, so I'd probably have a small switch somewhat transparent in the background, with something like "Have you ever wanted to annoy someone for hours? This is the thing for you!". The switch in the background with the phrase would be enough to send chills down anyone's spine, because it's simple. You'd think it'd turn off, but after years of experience with annoying things that don't turn off, you'll know it won't work. It's not that simple. Get ready for pain.
