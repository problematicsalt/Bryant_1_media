I have learned the following:
* Starting with the most difficult thing to program for something you've never, ever touched before is really stupid. I probably could've used anything else to make my annoying machine, but I decided "No, I have to use the Arduino pro mini - it's the only thing I can use". That was my biggest mistake, and I am still struggling to figure out how to program everything I need to program. 
* Soldering is not that scary, but is still something I never want to do if I don't absolutely have to ever again. It's a heated object and requires precision when performing the act of soldering. I am not into that, I can't do that, and it's scary. My hands are too shaky and I'm going blind; probably not a good idea to use a hot piece of metal to solder header pins into very tiny holes. I melted some of the plastic, too. Thank God that didn't ruin the whole Arduino.
* I should never pursue a career involving any coding. This would be my downfall, as I find it too tedious and still have little to no idea what I'm doing. This whole project is a nightmare, and very few times have I actually found myself enjoying trying to finish it up. I do not enjoy coding and programming, and I certainly do not enjoy fumbling around in the dark with little to no idea where exactly I need to go to reach my end goal.
