Last week, for my project, I completed my write up and my parts list (of course, providing links and prices for each item I need). 
I was not able to submit a working prototype Friday, because I was trying to find everything for the write up. On top of that, I personally don't fancy the idea of wasting time on a prototype. 
Next, I most likely need to accomplish making a prototype (because I'm sure that's a requirement), and figure out what needs to be done to get my project finished up. Since I lack experience for a lot of what I'm dealing with, I'd probably need some help.
