	Five milestones needed to complete my installation:
* Putting all the hardware in my installation and checking to see if it all fits
* Painting the cardboard box to make my installation pretty
* Putting the hardware together
* Performing a satanic ritual
* Testing everything out, annoying people. Top Priority stuff right here.
	Out of these things, I can do the first two to three things right now (depending on if my stuff has arrived already). 
If not that, I can at least do the second thing at home. And I could do the fourth thing right now, but I might disturb my classmates. I don't want to do that, but if that's what I need to do, I'll do that.
	My current plan is to do the first three things (putting all the hardware together today (unless my stuff isn't here), then paint my box when I get home.
After that, I could probably start putting it together tomorrow and running the code. I have no clue when I can perform my satanic ritual, but I'm sure by Thursday to Friday (at the latest) I'll be nearly done with milestone five. 
On Monday next week, I want to go around and annoy people the best I can. Hopefully this will be successful.
