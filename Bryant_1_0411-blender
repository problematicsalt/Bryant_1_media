1) How can animation be part of interactive media?
Well, if you have animation, it's twice as interactive. I learned this when I animated my music video by hand, and everyone seemed to like it (this surprised me). You also mentioned animating text and pictures would help engage the audience more.
2) What are the 3 axes in 3 dimensional space?
My one weakness. I'm pretty sure it's X Y and Z, though.
3) Why do animators work in 3 dimensional space?
Why did we replace skilled workers with machines and unskilled workers that just know how to press a button? It's easier, faster, and makes more money. I strongly dislike the use of 3 dimensional animation in *any* context, though.
4) Why do a walk-through tutorial for Blender? 
Why do we teach unskilled workers how to press buttons, and where those buttons are? They need to know. It's hard to find things for something you don't have experience with, and tutorials work as a guide to help you with that.


I still strongly dislike 3 dimensional animation.
