What is it about the animation process that appeals to you?
That's hilarious. I strongly dislike animation, and find it way too tedious to work on and do. I'd cry if I had to do animation - especially 3D animation - for a living.

What do you struggle with?
I struggle with every aspect of animation and 3D modeling. I lack spacial awareness and I'm just not good with it. 

Would you like to focus the remainder of our time on animation? Why or why not?

No. no. NO. n o. I would honestly not want to focus the rest of the next month on animation. I cannot stand it and feel I'd be happier doing something else. It's too difficult and too tedious - I'm already falling behind because I'm having so much trouble with Blender and 3D modeling in general. I'd prefer to do things similar to what we did at the beginning of the year, really. But, I don't think the majority of the class would agree, so I doubt that's what's going to happen.
