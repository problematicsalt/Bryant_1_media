What is the rising action?

What is the climax?

What are the sounds in your sound story?

The events in the story that lead up to / cause the climax are a part of the rising action.
The climax is the turning point of the story.
The sounds in my story are, very specifically, the sounds of footsteps walking through the woods, then a dog barking, more walking through the woods (through leaves and twigs you feel me), then more barking and whimpering.
