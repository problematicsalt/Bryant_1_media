1) What are you working on now?

I am working on getting my switches to work with my buzzers.

2) What challenges are you facing?

One of my buzzers broke, and I still have no idea how to get the switches to work on their own, let alone with the other buzzer I have.
I should figure that out later, though.

3) What will you accomplish this week?

I will hopefully accomplish getting my switches to work with the buzzer I have, and creating a very, very annoying sound that can be turned off.

4) What will you need to do to accomplish your goals this week?

I need to look up everything I can to figure out what to do with these switches, mainly. 

5) What deliverables will you have at the end of the week?

"Deliverable:
a thing able to be provided, especially as a product of a development process."

Oh. Well, at the very least I should have a sound. Hopefully, I'll have the switch included too.
