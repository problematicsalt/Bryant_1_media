Hoo, boy. I've learned a lot over the past week alone. 
I'll write down what I feel is notable, but this definitely not all I've learned:
* It was bad to start working with Arduinos by beginning with a Pro Mini. 
* It was really bad.
* A horrible mistake on my part.

With myself, however, I've only become more aware of things I already knew. 
First off, I know I'm an anxious and shaky person to begin with, but it seems getting near really warm objects that could burn me makes it a lot worse. And because of that, I forget to use common sense (ex; metal bends. I forgot about that yesterday).
Second, I have too much pride to ask for help. Way, way too much pride, as well as paranoia of ridicule for asking seemingly dumb or ridiculous questions. I find it easier to just look for the answer on my own, during my own time to avoid possible confrontation. 
And finally, I'm way too ambitious. That needs to stop. I am suffering with this project because I'm so ambitious. It's like Donald Trump with building the wall over the Mexican border - it won't work out, but that's definitely not stopping him from trying anyway.
