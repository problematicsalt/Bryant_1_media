The deliverable that I have currently is randomized sound (that needs to be revised, but that's just whatever for now). This is basically what I've managed to accomplish in this short, 3-day week.
What I have left to do is refine the sound (again), add a switch, and figure out if I want to keep going from there. Not sure how I'll incorporate the accelerator at this point, but I'll see what I can do.
