What will you accomplish today?

List 7 sounds you will use in your sound story.

I will finally finish my sound story, because that is very important. However, I put my revision for my music video in the DIM folder again, just in case you didn't get it the first time. So, that's a thing.
For my sound story, I know for sure I'm using various audio clips using walking and leaf crunching/twig snapping noises, as well as audio for a dog barking. Other than that, I'm still fiddling around with things and trying to figure it all out.
