On Monday, I refined my write up part list links, as I did on Tuesday and Wednesday. The reason this took so long was because I wasn't exactly sure what I was looking for (since the instructions and the parts list provided was somewhat vague, and only included UK links). On Thursday, I took a break and helped a classmate with his project's prototype, since I haven't been able to really start on mine.
I won't have anything to display until next week, but I'm planning on skipping the prototyping.
