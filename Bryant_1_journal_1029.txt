Describe the music - what is it like? How is it like you?

Which words will you be including? Why?

The music is a barely coherent mess. It isn't pleasing to the ear, and shows my extreme lack of knowledge in regards to making music. This describes me to a T, because I know very little about a lot of things, and am also not pleasing to the ear. I'm gross.
I will include the words/phrases "Fabulous", "Fight me", "Me at the club", "I am the verb", "Salty", "Short", "Problematic fave", and "SINnamon Roll".
